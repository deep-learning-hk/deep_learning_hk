# Meetup Deep Learning HK

## About
This is a group for the passionate "Deep Learner" who put a lot of time on building, studying, playing around with deep neural network models. We started this group to meet other Deep Learners to dig deeper into the theories and technical stuff behind all kind of state-of-the-art deep neural network model.

## Our Goals
- Review some of the latest academic papers/books and implement them by real coding.
- Discuss fast prototyping and the Deep Learning's application pipeline.
- Take a real problem and build the models to solve it together.
- And do anything about Deep Learning.

Our topic will include Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, NLP and all other kinds of applications which need to utilize deep neural networks.
